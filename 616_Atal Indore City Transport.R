# Peak:

# By running the simulation, the optimal number of buses for peak time is 24 
# buses for 'go', and 26 buses for 'back', 50 buses in total. Then we assume 
# the average speed at peak time is 15 km/h, and the route length is 11.57 km. 
# Then we calculated the average time needed from the first stop to the last
# stop. It is 46.28 mins. Next, we calculated the frequency. It is 2.5 mins for
# peak time go, and 2.31 mins for peak time back. Finally, we divide the average
# time by the frequency to find out the total bus number. It is 19 for peak time 
# go, and 21 for peak time back. Total 40 buses.

# Nonpeak:

# By running the simulation, the optimal number of buses for nonpeak time is 8 
# buses for 'go', and 9 buses for 'back', 17 buses in total. Then we assume 
# the average speed at peak time is 20 km/h, and the route length is 11.57 km. 
# Then we calculated the average time needed from the first stop to the last
# stop. It is 34.71 mins. Next, we calculated the frequency. It is 7.5 mins for
# peak time go, and 6.67 mins for peak time back. Finally, we divide the average
# time by the frequency to find out the total bus number. It is 5 for peak time 
# go, and 6 for peak time back. Total 11 buses.
